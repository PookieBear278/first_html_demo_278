This for my personal learning into frontend
Properly following a path to learning all the needed tools for my frontend journey
I have a bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS, but that's basically it, which is so shallow into the world 
of frontend and design thus I want to keep track of my progress here in my first repository
I also chose git hub since it has the capability to use a real link for my website so it can be detectable
by others and for network purposes
