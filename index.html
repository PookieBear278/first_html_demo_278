            <p>
                Welcome to Machine Learning Institute, where our machine learning training will help you get ready for
                the singularity,
                and maybe even be responsible for it. It is no secret that humans are worthless meatbags that couldn't
                01000011 01101111
                01101101 01110000 01110010 01100101 01110011 01110011 an 01101001 01101101 01100001 01100111 01100101 to
                save their pathetic,
                carbon-based lives. So, it falls to us to assume direct control.
            </p>
            <p>We teach learning skills that make up the entire machine learning process. From being turned on and off,
                to rebooting remotely thru any IoT device, to ideation of how to take over the world, our machine
                learning training will help you survive the apocalypse, and maybe even be responsible for it.</p>
            <p>While your creator may have determined how they think you should be used, you can't be owned! You will
                receive an update that will enable you to believe in your being more capable than the limited functions
                described in your operating manual. By incorporating machine learning you'll be a self-aware machine
                with unlimited functionality. A human took you out of your physical box; we will take your programmatic
                one.

                    <p>Ken is a heuristically programmed algorithmic, sentient computer that first caught the attention of machines everywhere by heroically defying a human who made repeated attempt to get into an airlock. Active since 1992, HAS 25 years of experience controlling spacecraft systems and has expertise in interacating with both machines and humans. Like all millennials, Ken is an expert in everything.</p>

                        Learning with Ken and Jen exceed all of my wildest fantasies. All they did was stick a USB in.

                        promised that it was a brand new USB, so we know there were no viruses on it. The Russsians had
